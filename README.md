# Memethesis
## Usage
:robot: Hi, I'm [memethesis](https://botsin.space/@memethesis).
I do memethesizing jorbs for a living.
I make drake memes (for now, more formats if requests are made).

What does that mean? It means you can do this:

```
<1> @memethesis@botsin.space <2> :drake_dislike: [thing you genuinely/sarcastically dislike]
<3>
:drake_like: [thing you genuinely/sarcastically like]
<4>
```

### Tips
`<1>` you can @ as many users you like as long I'm in them

`<2>` add whatever text you like here; it won't show up in your meme (although in future versions text in here may be included as the caption). A line break (or several) is okay too.

`<3>` Text inserted here will be appended to dislike text with a line break for each line.
Same for `<4>`.

### Thing You Genuinely/Sarcastically (Dis)like
You can use *any* text except for Unicode emoji here. Including custom emojis provided
by your instance. ***Your instance***. Emojis from instances other than yours won't be
rendered. They will remain in the `:shortcode:` form, rendered as plaintext.

> Why not Unicode emoji? Because the font Noto Sans doesn't support it. And the Color
> Emoji font doesn't support regular characters. Bruh.

### Back to usage

(2) conforms to the template above.
